    Before planning how I wanted to creatively tackle this assignment, 
    I examined the perspectives of the buildings currently existing in the city of Baltimore. 
    Knowing that the photographer probably hopped out of his car parked in the picture, ran across the street, 
    and snapped a quick photo looking down towards the area that was abandoned. I automatically knew I would 
    have to play around in the transform tools to appropriately put any other layered picture into the current abandoned lot.

So knowing that, I then wanted to think of something creative to add to the picture and I thought why not throw 
in the parting seas as a different background. After googling that using the special tools to limit the search 
to only large file pictures (to make the added picture look more realistic. If the file I added in was a lot smaller 
and I had to stretch it, it would have looked weird and pixelated.) I saved it onto my flash drive. Then I opened both files
 in photoshop and began layering the parting seas into this existing image.
